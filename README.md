# E-Store Builder

## About The Project

👩‍💻 This is an e-store builder, using which you can setup your own online store without any prerequisite knowledge of software development. We would like the application to be responsive and helpful to its users.

We would also like to add support for frontend and backend part of user's online store by managing their 
order details,payment details and customer feedbacks.

# How to Setup

### 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [e-StoreBuilder](https://github.com/techhub-community/e-StoreBuilder) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button on top-right of your screen.



### 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

`NOTE: commands are to be executed on Linux, Mac, and Windows(using Powershell)`

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/techhub-community/e-StoreBuilder.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.
Once you have cloned the `e-StoreBuilder` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on Linux, Mac, and Windows(PowerShell to be used).
```sh
# This will change directory to a folder e-StoreBuilder
$ cd e-StoreBuilder
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

### 3. Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/e-StoreBuilder.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/e-StoreBuilder.git (push)
```

Now, let's add a reference to the original [e-StoreBuilder](https://github.com/techhub-community/e-StoreBuilder/) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/techhub-community/e-StoreBuilder.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.
See the changes using
```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/e-StoreBuilder.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/e-StoreBuilder.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/e-StoreBuilder.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/e-StoreBuilder.git (push)
